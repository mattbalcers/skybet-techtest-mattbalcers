Spent around 3.5 hours looking at basic functionality and styling.

Intended on creating multiple media queries, however given time constraints chose not to and initial design generated was to create pattern to be used on desktop as a columnal element which could be re-used or adapted across multiple platforms. Set at 320px max-width.

I would of added the functionality to remove bets from a betslip, via the betslip, as this currently is missing - this is an area I identified for improvement in the JS provided.

Adding the ability to switch between decimal and fractional odds.

I'd of liked to have added some conditional/error state formatting to show different states on a betslip, should there be errors.

Some additional visual styling for bet receipts as they currently appear quite dry.

Also, some tooltips or info points to give users some introductory/basic information could of also been added given more time - further enhancing the experience (particulartly introductory experiences).

By utilising some more of SkyBet's brand assets the styling of the entire design could be drastically improved.

With the amount of bets pulled through on the demo API, this was not warranted, however I would of liked to look at adding search or some form of sortability to quickly find markets, enhancing the users journey. This is an area I identified for improvement in the JS provided - potentially for future candidates it would be good to see how designers/developers deal with scalability?

I know my CSS can be improved further to reduce inherited rules.

I'd be more than happy to use some of the Tech Fund to continue to better and update my coding skills.
